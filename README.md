# Fitsen - Dialogflow Agent

With the busy schedule of the 21st century, people are finding it difficult to take out proper time for hitting the gym or to maintain a healthy lifestyle. This leads to not just physical, but mental problems. To counter this deteriorating lifestyle, we created Fitsen. Fitsen is a revolutionary voice-based fitness training system which gives you the power to model your workouts, exercises and keep your mental health in check according to the limited time you have available. 

Standing at a metro station waiting for your train? Just tell Fitsen that you got 5 minutes and Fitsen will suggest exercises accordingly. Exercises that you can do while standing at the metro station!

Thinking of eating a healthy diet but donâ€™t have the time to go to a meal planner? Fitsen will handle that for you!

Feeling stressed, overwhelmed or tense? Or maybe just want some motivation? Fitsen can calm down your nerves, teach you to meditate, give you your daily dose of motivation and much more!

Fitsen will schedule your workouts, remind you of them each day, customize them according to the time you have available, and will integrate getting healthy into your hectic schedule without being intrusive!

The icing on the cake is a web-based portal which lets users check out their past workout statistics, connect with virtual trainers, therapists, nutritionists, and more!
